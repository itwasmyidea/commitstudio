## General Questions

### What is CommitStudio?
CommitStudio is an AI-powered tool that analyzes git diffs and provides insightful code review comments. It can also rewrite commit messages to be more descriptive using its YOLO mode.

### Is CommitStudio free to use?
CommitStudio is available as an open-source tool, but it requires an OpenAI API key which has associated costs depending on usage.

### Which AI models does CommitStudio support?
CommitStudio supports several OpenAI models including gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, o4-mini, and o3-mini.

## Usage Questions

### Can I use CommitStudio in CI/CD pipelines?
Yes, CommitStudio can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate code reviews. You'll need to set up the appropriate environment variables for authentication.

### Can CommitStudio work with private repositories?
Yes, CommitStudio works with private repositories. You'll need to provide a GitHub token with 'repo' scope to access private repositories.

### How do I limit which commits are analyzed?
You can use the `--commits` option to limit the number of commits, `--branch` to specify a branch, `--since` to set a date, or `--author` to filter by author.

## Technical Questions

### How does caching work in CommitStudio?
CommitStudio caches processed commits to avoid analyzing and commenting on the same commits multiple times. Cache files are stored in `~/.commitstudio/cache/`.

### How secure is my code when using CommitStudio?
Your code diffs are sent to OpenAI's API for analysis. OpenAI's data usage policies apply. GitHub tokens and OpenAI keys are stored locally on your machine in an encrypted format.

### Can I customize the prompts used for AI analysis?
The current version doesn't support customizing the prompts directly, but you can choose different AI models that affect the analysis style and depth.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I seeing "API rate limit exceeded" errors?
GitHub API has a limit of 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated users. Try reducing the number of commits you're analyzing or wait for the rate limit to reset.

### How do I reset my saved credentials?
Use the `--reset` flag to clear all saved settings and credentials:

```bash
commitstudio --reset
```

### The analysis isn't as detailed as I expected. What can I do?
Try using a more powerful model like gpt-4o and increase the max tokens:

```bash
commitstudio config --model gpt-4o --max-tokens 4000
```
