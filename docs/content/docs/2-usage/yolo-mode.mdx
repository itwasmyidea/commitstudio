## How YOLO Mode Works

Behind the scenes, YOLO mode follows a sophisticated process:

1. **Preparation**
   - Verifies that your working tree is clean to avoid losing uncommitted changes
   - Identifies the commits to process based on your filtering criteria
   - Extracts the diff content for each commit

2. **AI Analysis**
   - For each commit, sends the code diff to the AI model
   - Uses a specialized prompt that instructs the AI to:
     - Analyze what changes were made
     - Determine the purpose behind the changes
     - Identify the key components affected
     - Understand technical implications

3. **Message Generation**
   - Generates clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Structures messages with:
     - A concise but informative summary line
     - Detailed body explaining the changes
     - Rationale for the changes when context is available
   - Optionally adds appropriate emojis based on the content type

4. **Git History Rewriting**
   - Uses Git's interactive rebase to modify commit messages
   - Preserves all commit content and authorship information
   - Maintains the same commit sequence and relationships

5. **Results Presentation**
   - Shows before/after comparison for each message
   - Provides guidance on pushing updated history

## Before & After Examples

<div className="overflow-x-auto">
<table className="w-full my-4">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Before</th>
      <th>After</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>fix bug</code></td>
      <td><code>üêõ Fix authentication timeout issue in login</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>update UI</code></td>
      <td><code>‚ú® Update user dashboard with responsive design</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>refactor</code></td>
      <td><code>‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor data pipeline for better performance</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>WIP</code></td>
      <td><code>üöß Implement user notification system</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>typo</code></td>
      <td><code>üìù Fix typos in API documentation</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## When to Use YOLO Mode

YOLO mode is particularly valuable for:

- **Legacy Projects**: Improving historical documentation
- **Before Public Release**: Cleaning up commit history before open-sourcing
- **Code Reviews**: Making the review process more efficient with better context
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Helping new team members understand project history
- **Documentation**: Creating better release notes from commit logs

## Command Options in Detail

```bash
commitstudio yolo [options]
```

### Basic Options

- `-p, --path <path>`: Path to the git repository (default: current directory)
- `-c, --commits <number>`: Number of commits to analyze (default: last 5)
- `-b, --branch <branch>`: Branch to analyze (default: current branch)

### Filtering Options

- `--since <date>`: Only analyze commits after this date (e.g., "2023-01-01")
- `--author <email>`: Only analyze commits by this author
- `--include-merge`: Include merge commits in the analysis (default: excluded)

### Styling Options

- `--emoji`: Add contextually appropriate emojis to commit messages (default: on)
- `--serious`: Generate professional messages without emojis
- `--prefix <text>`: Add a custom prefix to each commit message

### Execution Options

- `--dry-run`: Preview changes without modifying Git history
- `--verbose`: Show detailed logs during processing
- `--interactive`: Confirm each message change individually

## How AI Generates Better Messages

The AI analyzes several aspects of your commit to generate improved messages:

1. **Code Diff Analysis**
   - Identifies files modified, added, or deleted
   - Examines specific code changes and patterns
   - Recognizes language-specific constructs and features

2. **Commit Type Detection**
   - Feature additions
   - Bug fixes
   - Performance improvements
   - Refactoring
   - Documentation changes
   - Test additions

3. **Technical Context Inference**
   - Component relationships
   - Architectural patterns
   - Common programming idioms
   - Platform-specific considerations

4. **Message Formatting Best Practices**
   - Follows the 50/72 rule (50 char title, 72 char body lines)
   - Uses imperative present tense
   - Starts with a clear action verb
   - Provides supporting details in the body

## Detailed Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Rewrite the last 5 commit messages with emojis
commitstudio yolo
```

Terminal output:
```
‚úì Repository detected: username/project-name
‚úì Working tree is clean
‚úì Analyzing commits for rewriting...
‚úì Generating improved commit messages...

1. Before: "fix login bug"
   After:  "üêõ Fix user authentication timeout in login form"

2. Before: "add feature"
   After:  "‚ú® Add multi-factor authentication with email verification"

3. Before: "cleanup"
   After:  "‚ôªÔ∏è Remove deprecated authentication methods and refactor auth flow"

4. Before: "css updates"
   After:  "üíÑ Update login form styling with responsive design and dark mode support"

5. Before: "lint fix"
   After:  "üßπ Fix ESLint warnings in authentication components"

? Apply these changes to your commit history? (Y/n) y
‚úì Successfully rewrote commit messages!

Remember: You'll need to force push these changes with:
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Rewrite messages since January 1st by a specific author, without emojis
commitstudio yolo --since "2023-01-01" --author "dev@example.com" --serious --dry-run
```

## Important Cautions

### Git History Rewriting Considerations

YOLO mode uses `git rebase -i` to rewrite commit messages, which changes commit hashes. This means:

1. **Clean Working Tree Required**: You must have a clean working tree (no uncommitted changes) before running YOLO mode. CommitStudio will check this and refuse to proceed if changes are detected.

2. **Local-Only By Default**: Changes are applied to your local repository only. You must explicitly push them to share with others.

3. **Force Push Required**: After running YOLO mode, you'll need to use `git push --force-with-lease` to update remote branches. Regular pushes will be rejected.

4. **Collaboration Impact**: History rewriting can cause problems for collaborators who have based work on the original commits. Best practices:
   - Only use on personal/feature branches
   - Communicate with your team when using on shared branches
   - Consider creating a backup branch before proceeding

5. **CI/CD Considerations**: History rewrites may trigger new CI/CD runs for the same code

## Integration with Development Workflow

YOLO mode integrates best with these workflows:

1. **Feature Branch Cleanup**:
   - Develop on a feature branch
   - Before creating a PR, run YOLO mode
   - Force push the improved history
   - Create a clean, professional PR

2. **Personal Repository Management**:
   - Run periodically on your repositories
   - Creates a cleaner project history
   - Makes release notes generation easier

3. **Pre-Tag Cleanup**:
   - Before creating version tags
   - Ensures release history is professional
   - Improves documentation for releases
