description: How to install CommitStudio and set up your credentials
---

## Prerequisites

Before installing CommitStudio, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher installed on your system
2. **Git**: Installed and configured on your system
3. **GitHub Repository**: A repository on GitHub that you want to analyze
4. **API Credentials**:
   - A GitHub personal access token with 'repo' scope
   - An OpenAI API key

## Installation Methods

### Global Installation (Recommended)

Installing CommitStudio globally allows you to run it from any directory:

```bash
# Install globally with npm
npm install -g commitstudio

# OR install globally with pnpm
pnpm add -g commitstudio

# OR install globally with yarn
yarn global add commitstudio
```

After installation, verify it's working:

```bash
commitstudio --version
```

### Using Without Installation

You can run CommitStudio directly without installing it using npx:

```bash
npx commitstudio
```

This approach will download and execute CommitStudio on demand, ensuring you always use the latest version.

## Setting Up Credentials

CommitStudio requires authentication with both GitHub and OpenAI. You have several options to provide these credentials:

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set up environment variables to avoid entering credentials every time:

```bash
# GitHub personal access token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

For permanent setup, add these to your shell profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.).

### Interactive Prompt

If credentials aren't found in environment variables, CommitStudio will prompt you to enter them interactively during the first run.

### Optional: GitHub OAuth Setup

For a browser-based authentication flow instead of using a personal access token:

1. Create a GitHub OAuth App at: https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Set the Authorization callback URL to: https://github.com/devices
3. Set the Client ID as an environment variable:

```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
```

## GitHub Access Token

CommitStudio requires a GitHub personal access token to:
- Access repository information
- Fetch commit details
- Post comments to commits

### Creating a GitHub Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" (classic)
3. Give it a descriptive name like "CommitStudio"
4. Select the `repo` scope (this grants access to your repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the generated token (you'll only see it once!)

## OpenAI API Key

CommitStudio uses OpenAI's API to analyze code. You need an API key with sufficient quota.

### Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Create an account or sign in at [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Go to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Create a new secret key
4. Give it a name like "CommitStudio"
5. Copy your API key (you'll only see it once!)

## Verifying Your Installation

After installation, verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Check the installed version
commitstudio --version

# View available commands and options
commitstudio --help
```

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Node.js Version Error

If you see an error about Node.js version, upgrade Node.js:

```bash
# Using nvm (Node Version Manager)
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# OR download the latest version from nodejs.org
```

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors during global installation:

```bash
# Install with sudo (not recommended)
sudo npm install -g commitstudio

# OR fix npm permissions (recommended)
# https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally
```

### Connection Issues

If CommitStudio can't connect to GitHub or OpenAI:

1. Verify your internet connection
2. Check that your API keys are correct
3. Ensure you don't have a proxy or firewall blocking connections

## Next Steps

Now that CommitStudio is installed, you can:
