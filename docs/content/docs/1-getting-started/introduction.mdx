## Overview

CommitStudio is an AI-powered tool that automates code reviews by analyzing git diffs and providing insightful comments on your commits. It integrates with GitHub to post these comments directly on your commits or pull requests, allowing you to receive quality feedback with minimal human intervention.

Additionally, it offers "YOLO mode" which can rewrite your commit messages to make them more descriptive and professional using AI, making your commit history more meaningful and useful.

## Key Features

- **Auto-detect Repository**: Works with local git repositories, automatically connects to GitHub
- **Smart Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to analyze git diffs and generate insightful comments
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly post comments to GitHub pull requests
- **YOLO Mode**: Rewrite your commit messages with AI to be more descriptive and professional
- **Caching**: Smart caching to avoid repeated analyses
- **Interactive CLI**: Easy-to-use command line interface with helpful prompts
- **Secure Credentials Management**: Securely handles GitHub and OpenAI API keys
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple commits at once
- **Flexible Options**: Analyze specific commits, branches, or time periods
- **Customizable AI Settings**: Choose your preferred AI model and adjust token limits

## How It Works

CommitStudio uses a series of steps to provide AI-powered code reviews:

1. **Repository Detection**: The tool detects your git repository and connects to GitHub
2. **Commit Fetching**: It fetches all commits or uses filters you specify
3. **Diff Analysis**: For each commit, it gets the diff using git
4. **AI Processing**: The diff is sent to OpenAI's API for analysis
5. **Result Formatting**: Results are formatted into structured comments
6. **GitHub Integration**: Comments are posted to GitHub using the GitHub API
7. **Caching**: Processed commits are cached to avoid duplication

In YOLO mode, it follows a similar process but instead of posting comments, it rewrites your commit messages to be more descriptive.

## Example Use Cases

CommitStudio excels in several scenarios:

### Individual Developers
- Get AI-powered code review feedback without waiting for team members
- Improve code quality before sharing with others
- Learn best practices and identify potential issues early

### Development Teams
- Add an additional layer of automated review to your workflow
- Ensure consistent code quality across the team
- Reduce the time spent on basic code review tasks

### Open Source Projects
- Provide automated feedback to contributors
- Maintain high quality standards with minimal manual oversight
- Improve commit message quality and documentation

## Why Use CommitStudio?

### Time Saving
CommitStudio analyzes your code changes automatically, providing immediate feedback without waiting for human reviewers.

### Quality Improvement
The AI can spot issues that humans might miss, especially in large diffs or late-night coding sessions.

### Learning Tool
CommitStudio's suggestions help developers learn better coding practices and identify anti-patterns.

### Consistency
Get the same level of detailed feedback on every commit, ensuring consistent code quality.
