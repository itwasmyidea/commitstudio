# Output Format

CommitStudio produces structured output for code reviews. This document explains the format of the AI-generated analysis results.

## Analysis Structure

Each commit analysis is structured with three main components:

1. **Summary**: A high-level overview of the changes
2. **Comments**: Detailed observations on specific parts of the code
3. **Suggestions**: Recommendations for improvements

## JSON Structure

When accessing the analysis programmatically, the data is structured as follows:

```json
{
  "commitSha": "abc123...",
  "commitMessage": "Original commit message",
  "summary": "A comprehensive overview of the changes in this commit...",
  "comments": [
    {
      "file": "src/utils/helpers.js",
      "line": "42",
      "content": "This function might cause memory leaks because..."
    },
    {
      "file": "src/components/Button.tsx",
      "content": "The naming convention used here differs from the rest of the codebase..."
    }
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider adding unit tests for the new utility functions",
    "The error handling could be improved to be more specific about failure modes"
  ]
}
```

## Fields Explanation

### Root Level

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `commitSha` | String | The SHA identifier of the analyzed commit |
| `commitMessage` | String | The original commit message |
| `summary` | String | A comprehensive overview of the changes |
| `comments` | Array | Specific observations about parts of the code |
| `suggestions` | Array | Recommendations for improvements |

### Comments

Each entry in the `comments` array has the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `file` | String | The path to the file being commented on |
| `line` | String (optional) | The line number if the comment is line-specific |
| `content` | String | The actual comment text |

## GitHub Comment Format

When posted to GitHub, the analysis is formatted as a markdown comment with sections:

```markdown
## AI Code Review Summary

An overview of the changes in this commit, discussing the main modifications and their impact.

### Specific Comments

#### src/utils/helpers.js

This function might cause memory leaks because it doesn't properly clean up event listeners.

#### src/components/Button.tsx

The naming convention used here differs from the rest of the codebase, which could lead to confusion.

### Suggestions

1. Consider adding unit tests for the new utility functions
2. The error handling could be improved to be more specific about failure modes
