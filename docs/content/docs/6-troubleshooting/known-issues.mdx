## Previous Issues (Now Fixed)

### ✅ Punycode Deprecation Warning (DEP0040) - Partially Fixed in v0.3.6

**Issue:** Node.js ≥18.16.0 shows DEP0040 punycode deprecation warnings due to dependencies that use the deprecated punycode module.

**Fix Status:** 

We've partially fixed this by ensuring proper compatibility with ESLint:

```json
"overrides": {
  "@eslint/eslintrc": {
    "ajv": "6.12.6"
  }
}
```

Additionally, we've added the `--no-warnings` flag to the CLI commands to suppress warnings.

**If you're still seeing this warning:** You can run CommitStudio with:

```bash
NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 commitstudio
```

The warnings are harmless and don't affect functionality.
