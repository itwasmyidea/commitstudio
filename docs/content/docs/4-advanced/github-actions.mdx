# GitHub Actions Integration

CommitStudio can be easily integrated with GitHub Actions to automatically analyze pull requests and provide code review comments directly in GitHub.

## Setting Up the GitHub Action

Create a new GitHub Action workflow file in your repository at `.github/workflows/commitstudio.yml`:

```yaml
name: CommitStudio Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install CommitStudio
        run: npm install -g commitstudio
      
      - name: Run CommitStudio Analysis
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          commitstudio --path . --branch ${{ github.head_ref }}
```

## Required Secrets

Ensure you have the following secrets set in your GitHub repository:

1. `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key to enable AI analysis

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically provided by GitHub Actions and doesn't need to be manually configured.

## Customizing the Workflow

### Adjusting Model and Tokens

You can adjust the AI model and token settings by adding environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
  OPENAI_MODEL: gpt-4o
  OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS: 4000
```

### Running on Specific Paths

To run CommitStudio only when specific files are changed:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.js'
      - '**.ts'
      - '**.jsx'
      - '**.tsx'
```

### Adding Custom Options

Additional command-line options can be added to customize behavior:

```yaml
run: |
  commitstudio --path . --branch ${{ github.head_ref }} --no-cache --verbose
```

## Example: Commenting Only on Changed Files

This example configures CommitStudio to only analyze and comment on files that were changed in the pull request:

```yaml
name: CommitStudio Code Review (Changed Files Only)

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  code-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install CommitStudio
        run: npm install -g commitstudio
      
      - name: Get changed files
        id: changed-files
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v40
        
      - name: Run CommitStudio Analysis
        if: steps.changed-files.outputs.any_changed == 'true'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          OPENAI_MODEL: gpt-4.1-mini
        run: |
          commitstudio --path . --branch ${{ github.head_ref }} --files "${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}"
```
