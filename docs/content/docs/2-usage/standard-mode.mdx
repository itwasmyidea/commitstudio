# Standard Mode

Standard mode is CommitStudio's primary analysis tool, providing in-depth AI-powered code review for your Git repositories. This mode analyzes code changes, generates insightful feedback, and posts comments directly to GitHub.

## How Standard Mode Works

CommitStudio's standard mode follows a sophisticated multi-step process:

1. **Repository Detection**
   - Detects the Git repository from the current directory or specified path
   - Identifies the GitHub remote and repository owner/name
   - Verifies access permissions with your GitHub token

2. **Commit Selection**
   - Retrieves commits based on your filtering options (count, branch, date, author)
   - Identifies which commits have already been processed (using cache)
   - Prepares unprocessed commits for analysis

3. **Diff Generation**
   - Uses Git to extract the diff for each commit
   - Formats diffs to optimize for AI analysis
   - Ensures context is preserved for accurate review

4. **AI Analysis**
   - Sends the formatted diff to OpenAI's API
   - Uses a specialized prompt that instructs the AI to:
     - Identify bugs, security issues, and code smells
     - Suggest improvements and best practices
     - Consider language-specific conventions
     - Provide constructive, actionable feedback
   - Processes the response into structured comment format

5. **GitHub Integration**
   - Connects to GitHub using your personal access token
   - Posts AI-generated comments on the specific commits
   - Formats comments with Markdown for readability
   - Ensures comments are properly attributed to CommitStudio

6. **Results Caching**
   - Stores processed commits in a local cache
   - Avoids reanalyzing the same commits in future runs
   - Optimizes performance and reduces API costs

7. **Feedback Presentation**
   - Displays a summary of the analysis in the terminal
   - Shows progress indicators during analysis
   - Provides links to the GitHub comments

## When to Use Standard Mode

Standard mode is ideal for:

- **Daily Development**: Regular code review during development
- **Pre-PR Review**: Catching issues before creating pull requests
- **Team Collaboration**: Sharing AI insights with your team
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring code meets quality standards
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Getting explanations of complex code

## Command Syntax and Options

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Use default settings
commitstudio

# Specify repository path
commitstudio --path /path/to/repo
```

### Commit Selection

```bash
# Analyze specific number of commits
commitstudio --commits 5

# Analyze commits on a specific branch
commitstudio --branch feature/new-feature

# Analyze commits since a date
commitstudio --since "2023-01-01"

# Analyze commits from a specific author
commitstudio --author "user@example.com"
```

### Execution Options

```bash
# Analyze without posting to GitHub (preview mode)
commitstudio --dry-run

# Ignore cache and reanalyze all commits
commitstudio --no-cache

# Show detailed logs during analysis
commitstudio --verbose
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Reset all saved settings and credentials
commitstudio --reset

# Combine multiple options
commitstudio --commits 10 --branch develop --dry-run --verbose
```

## How AI Analysis Works

CommitStudio leverages advanced AI models to analyze your code:

### The Analysis Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**: The diff is prepared with appropriate context
2. **Tokenization**: The code is converted to tokens for the AI model
3. **AI Processing**: The model analyzes the tokens using its trained knowledge
4. **Response Generation**: The AI generates structured feedback
5. **Postprocessing**: The response is formatted into actionable comments

### What the AI Evaluates

- **Logical Errors**: Bugs, edge cases, and potential failures
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerabilities, injection risks, and unsafe practices
- **Performance Concerns**: Inefficient algorithms and resource usage
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability, readability, and best practices
- **Architecture**: Design patterns and structural improvements
- **Documentation**: Missing or unclear documentation

### AI Model Selection

The quality of analysis depends on the AI model used:

- **Default**: gpt-4.1-mini (balanced performance and cost)
- **For Critical Code**: Consider upgrading to gpt-4o or gpt-4.1
- **For Large Repositories**: Models with higher token limits help analyze more code

To change the model:
```bash
commitstudio config --model gpt-4o
```

## GitHub Integration Details

CommitStudio posts comments directly to your GitHub repository:

### Comment Placement

- **Commit Comments**: Posted on the specific commit that was analyzed
- **Line-Specific**: Comments tied to the relevant lines of code
- **Grouped**: Related issues are combined when appropriate

### Comment Formatting

- **Markdown Support**: Rich formatting with code blocks and lists
- **Issue Categorization**: Clear labeling of issue types
- **Code Context**: Relevant code snippets included
- **Suggested Solutions**: Actionable recommendations

### Permissions Required

- Your GitHub token must have the `repo` scope
- You must have write access to the repository
- CommitStudio respects repository permissions

## Real-World Example

Here's a typical terminal output when running standard mode:

```bash
âœ“ Repository detected: username/project-name
âœ“ GitHub connection established
âœ“ Found 7 commits to analyze (3 already processed)
âœ“ Analyzing diffs with AI...
  â†ª Analyzing commit 1/4: Add user authentication (65d7a9f)
  â†ª Analyzing commit 2/4: Fix pagination bug (18e2b3c)
  â†ª Analyzing commit 3/4: Implement search feature (24f1d8e)
  â†ª Analyzing commit 4/4: Update dependencies (93c7b5a)
âœ“ Posting comments to GitHub...
  â†ª Posted 3 comments on commit 65d7a9f
  â†ª Posted 1 comment on commit 18e2b3c
  â†ª Posted 2 comments on commit 24f1d8e
  â†ª Posted 0 comments on commit 93c7b5a
âœ“ CommitStudio completed successfully!

ðŸ“Š Summary: 4 commits analyzed, 6 comments posted
```

And on GitHub, comments appear like:

```markdown

### Potential Security Issue: SQL Injection Risk

The user input from `searchQuery` is directly concatenated into the SQL query,
creating a potential SQL injection vulnerability:

```js
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%${searchQuery}%'`;
```

**Recommendation**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection:

```js
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE ?`;
const params = [`%${searchQuery}%`];
```

This ensures user input is properly escaped and keeps your database secure.
```

## Optimizing Your Experience

To get the most out of standard mode:

1. **Make Focused Commits**: Smaller, focused commits get better analysis
2. **Use Descriptive Messages**: Helps the AI understand context
3. **Review Incrementally**: Address issues as they're identified
4. **Configure AI Model**: Choose the right model for your needs
5. **Use Dry Run**: Preview analysis before posting to GitHub
