## Authentication Errors

### GitHub Token Issues

**Problem**: GitHub authentication errors or "Not authorized" messages.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure your token has the 'repo' scope
- Check if your token has expired and regenerate if needed
- Use the `--reset` flag to clear saved credentials and enter a new token
  ```bash
  commitstudio --reset
  ```

### OpenAI API Key Issues

**Problem**: "Invalid API key" or OpenAI authentication errors.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the API key is valid in the OpenAI dashboard
- Check if your account has sufficient credits
- Use the `--reset` flag to clear saved credentials and enter a new key

## Repository Detection Problems

**Problem**: "Repository not found" or "Not a git repository" errors.

**Solutions**:
- Make sure you're in a git repository
- Ensure the repository has a GitHub remote
- Check that you have access to the repository
- Use the `--path` option to specify the repository path manually
  ```bash
  commitstudio --path /path/to/your/repo
  ```

## Node.js Deprecation Warnings

**Problem**: You see DEP0040 punycode deprecation warnings.

**Solutions**:
- These warnings are from dependencies and don't affect functionality
- Use the npm start script which includes the --no-deprecation flag
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- Or run with the flag directly:
  ```bash
  node --no-deprecation ./bin/cli.js
  ```

## GitHub API Rate Limits

**Problem**: "API rate limit exceeded" errors.

**Solutions**:
- GitHub API has a limit of 5,000 requests per hour for authenticated users
- Reduce the number of commits you're analyzing
- Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually 1 hour)
- Use a GitHub token with higher rate limits if available
