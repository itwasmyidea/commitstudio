## First Run Experience

CommitStudio offers a seamless first-run experience with intelligent defaults and interactive setup:

```bash
commitstudio
```

On your first run, CommitStudio will automatically:

1. **Detect credentials**: Check for existing GitHub token and OpenAI API key
2. **Interactive setup**: If credentials are missing, prompt for them interactively
3. **Repository detection**: Automatically identify your Git repository
4. **GitHub integration**: Connect to the corresponding GitHub repository 
5. **Configuration setup**: Set up default AI model and tokens (gpt-4.1-mini)
6. **Analysis**: Begin analyzing your code immediately after setup
7. **Caching**: Store your credentials securely for future use

You'll see a series of interactive prompts similar to:

```bash
‚úì Welcome to CommitStudio!
? GitHub token not found. Enter your GitHub personal access token: [hidden]
‚úì GitHub token validated!
? OpenAI API key not found. Enter your OpenAI API key: [hidden]
‚úì OpenAI API key validated!
‚úì Repository detected: user/repo-name
‚úì Analyzing commits...
```

## Basic Usage

After the initial setup, using CommitStudio is straightforward:

```bash
# In your Git repository
commitstudio
```

By default, CommitStudio will:
1. Analyze recent commits in your current branch
2. Use AI to generate insightful comments on code changes
3. Post these comments to GitHub (if not in dry-run mode)
4. Cache results to avoid duplicating work

You can also specify options:

```bash
# Analyze specific number of commits
commitstudio --commits 5

# Analyze specific branch
commitstudio --branch feature/new-feature

# Preview without posting to GitHub
commitstudio --dry-run
```

## YOLO Mode for Commit Messages

CommitStudio has a special "YOLO" mode that helps improve your commit messages:

```bash
commitstudio yolo
```

This mode will:
1. Analyze your recent commit messages
2. Generate improved, more descriptive messages
3. Rewrite your Git history with the new messages
4. Optionally add emojis for better readability

**Note:** YOLO mode requires a clean working tree and rewrites Git history.

## Configuration

You can easily customize CommitStudio:

```bash
# View current settings
commitstudio config --view

# Interactive configuration
commitstudio config

# Set specific model
commitstudio config --model gpt-4o
```

## Automatic Features

CommitStudio includes several automatic features to enhance your experience:

- **Smart caching**: Avoids reanalyzing the same commits
- **Repository autodetection**: Works in any Git repository
- **GitHub integration**: Automatically connects to the correct GitHub repo
- **Interactive fallbacks**: If autodetection fails, provides interactive selection
- **Credential management**: Securely stores tokens between sessions
- **Parallel processing**: Analyzes multiple commits simultaneously for speed
- **Rate limit handling**: Manages GitHub API limits automatically

## Example Complete Workflow

Here's how CommitStudio fits into your development process:

1. **Setup (one-time)**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g commitstudio
   cd your-project
   commitstudio  # First run with interactive setup
   ```

2. **Daily Development**:
   - Make code changes and commit them
   - Run `commitstudio` before submitting PRs
   - Review AI suggestions and fix issues
   - Use `commitstudio yolo` to clean up commit messages

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Add CommitStudio to your CI pipeline
   - Analyze PRs automatically
   - Get AI feedback directly in GitHub

## Understanding the Output

CommitStudio's analysis includes:

- **Summary**: Overview of analyzed changes
- **Issues**: Potential bugs, security concerns, and code smells
- **Improvements**: Suggested code refactorings and optimizations
- **Best practices**: Recommendations for better coding standards
- **Examples**: Example code that demonstrates improvements

Example output:

```bash
‚úì Found 3 commits to analyze
‚úì Analyzing diffs with AI...
  ‚Ü™ Analyzing commit: Add user authentication (a1b2c3d)
  ‚Ü™ Analyzing commit: Fix pagination bug (e4f5g6h)
  ‚Ü™ Analyzing commit: Implement search (i7j8k9l)
‚úì Analysis complete!

üìä Summary: 3 files changed with 250+ lines modified

üîç Key findings:
  - Potential SQL injection in search input
  - Authentication lacks proper error handling
  - Pagination implementation could be optimized

üí° Posted 5 review comments to GitHub
```

## Troubleshooting First Run

If you encounter issues during first run:

- **GitHub Token Issues**: Ensure your token has 'repo' scope
- **OpenAI API Key**: Verify the key is valid in the OpenAI dashboard
- **Repository Not Found**: Make sure you're in a Git repository with a GitHub remote
- **No Analysis Results**: Check that you have commits to analyze
