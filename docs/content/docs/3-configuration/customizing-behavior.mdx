## Standard Mode Customization

### Filtering Commits

You can filter which commits are analyzed using these options:

- **Number of Commits**: `--commits <number>` to limit to a specific number of recent commits
  ```bash
  commitstudio --commits 5
  ```

- **Branch Selection**: `--branch <branch-name>` to analyze a specific branch
  ```bash
  commitstudio --branch feature/new-feature
  ```

- **Date Filtering**: `--since <date>` to analyze commits after a specific date
  ```bash
  commitstudio --since "2023-01-01"
  ```

- **Author Filtering**: `--author <email>` to analyze commits from a specific author
  ```bash
  commitstudio --author "user@example.com"
  ```

### Dry Run Mode

Use the `--dry-run` flag to run CommitStudio without posting comments to GitHub:

```bash
commitstudio --dry-run
```

This is useful for testing or to review the analysis locally before publishing comments.

## YOLO Mode Customization

### Emoji Settings

- **Add emojis**: Use the `--emoji` flag (default) to add emojis to commit messages
  ```bash
  commitstudio yolo --emoji
  ```

- **Professional style**: Use the `--serious` flag for professional commit messages without emojis
  ```bash
  commitstudio yolo --serious
  ```

### Preview Mode

Use the `--dry-run` flag to preview changes without applying them:

```bash
commitstudio yolo --dry-run
```

## Verbose Output

For more detailed logging, use the `--verbose` flag:

```bash
commitstudio --verbose
```

This provides additional information about the analysis process, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
